GAME SETUP DIRECTIONS:

You need 2 Devices - 1 GAME SCREEN, 1 GAME CONTROLLER

GAME SCREEN: 
You will need one device to watch the game like you would watch a gameshow on tv.  Get a laptop or tablet.  If you choose a table check that the Zoom app is installed. Use this link to join the Zoom meeting.

Meeting ID: 964 954 4727

Setup the device so it is easy to watch.  You will not touch the screen during the game, you will only watch it.  When people join confirm they can hear you and see you.  If you are using the Zoom App you may need to tap the screen or hover over the screen with your cursor to get the audio and video icons to appear.  

GAME CONTROLLER:
Grab you smart phone and go to jackbox.tv website.  You will see a page with two fields ROOM CODE and NAME.  Wait until the GAME SCREEN is setup and it will show you the ROOM CODE.


TIPS working with Grandparents:
Allow extra time before the game for younger people to help the grandparents fumble through the Zoom controls.  Just tell the older people that game starts earlier than everyone else, they have nothing to do anyways.  
Be ready to call them and provide elder tech support via your mobile phone. Be prepared for terrible echoing from having Zoom audio and phone audio while you setup the grandparents. Don't worry about this noise offending the grandparents, they can't hear it anyways.
Old people have no filter anymore so be prepared to hear some foul language.  Usually the less tech savvy one has to yell at their spouse which is almost always in another room and definitely off screen.  This is a good time to test your mute button

TIPS for Stupid people:
The GAME SCREEN is how you watch the game and see the other players faces.
The GAME CONTROLLER is how you play the game.  When setting up a stupid player, try holding your phone with the jackboot.tv site loaded up to the Zoom video screen to show the person they have to pick up the other device.  Try texting them a link to the site so there is less room for error.
You only need one Zoom per physical location.  Setup the Zoom device so you can see everyone.
If you have to read this far, I feel for you.  Try self medicating with your favorite cocktail, wine or beer.
